## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

### Bio

I specialize in **React** and **TypeScript**, focusing on developing accessible, internationalized, and responsive web applications with a keen interest in light/dark modes. My approach emphasizes inclusive and user-centric solutions on a global scale.

### Problem Solving

I thrive on solving challenges related to UI/UX design, performance optimization, accessibility, responsive design, and integrating front-end with back-end services.

### Favorite Tool

My go-to front-end tool is **React**. Its component-based architecture and efficient state management empower me to create dynamic interfaces seamlessly.

### Reusable Components

I've created Typeweave, a React TypeScript UI library renowned for its reusable components tailored for accessibility and adaptable to light/dark modes. It comprises two main packages: @typeweave/react, offering comprehensive component libraries and styles, and @typeweave/plugin, a Tailwind CSS plugin providing essential theme variables.
