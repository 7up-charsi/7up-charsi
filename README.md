## Hi there! 👋

### Bio

Specializing in React and TypeScript, I excel at developing accessible, internationalized and responsive web apps with light/dark modes. I prioritize inclusive and user-centric solutions globally.

### Problem Solving

I thrive on solving challenges related to UI/UX design, performance optimization, accessibility, responsive design, and integrating front-end with back-end services.

### Favorite Tool

My go-to front-end tool is **React**. Its component-based architecture and efficient state management empower me to create dynamic interfaces seamlessly.

### Reusable Components

I've created Typeweave, a React TypeScript UI library renowned for its reusable components tailored for accessibility and adaptable to light/dark modes. It comprises two main packages: @typeweave/react, offering comprehensive component libraries and styles, and @typeweave/plugin, a Tailwind CSS plugin providing essential theme variables.
